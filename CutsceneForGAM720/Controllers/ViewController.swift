import UIKit
import AVFoundation

// Images are scaled to fill as they are examples and not final images.
// Images all have image view contraints of 0 for each edge
// Tested and fully functional on an iPhone 8
// Removed animation from Segue properties

// Current Plan - Add files for all the view controllers, link up, and add the AVFoundation framework for sounds. Sounds will have to be background for each controller and not loop/repeat unless nessessary.
